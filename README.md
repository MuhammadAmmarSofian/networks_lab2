# Fake Food Delivery API - McDonald's Clone

## Description

This project is a REST API for a fake food delivery system using FastAPI. It allows managing a menu for a single restaurant (McDonald's) and includes endpoints for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting menu items. The API also supports image uploads, sorting, filtering, and batch operations.

## Setup Instructions

Clone the Repository

$ git clone https://github.com/MuhammadAmmarSofian/networks_lab2

$ docker compose up --build

API will be available at: http://127.0.0.1:8000

## API Endpoints & Examples

### GET Requests

### POST Requests


Add a new menu item:

POST /menu
{
    "item_id": "7",
    "name": "Big Mac",
    "price": 5.99,
    "category": "Burger"
}


### PUT Requests

    "category": "Burger"
}

}


### DELETE Requests

DELETE /menu/{item_id}

Batch delete items by category:

## Idempotency Analysis

### Idempotent Routes:

These routes return the same response when called multiple times with the same input:

GET /menu â†’ Fetching menu items does not change the state.

GET /menu/{item_id} â†’ Fetching a specific item is read-only.

DELETE /menu/{item_id} â†’ If the item exists, it is deleted; if repeated, it returns 404 (same result).

DELETE /menu/batch_delete â†’ Deleting items by condition will always return the same response if repeated.

PUT /menu/{item_id} â†’ Updating an item with the same data multiple times has no extra effect.


### Non-Idempotent Routes

These routes modify the state and return different results on repeated calls:

POST /menu â†’ Creating a new item multiple times adds duplicates.

PUT /menu/batch_update â†’ Increases prices each time it is called.

ðŸ“Œ Notes

Ensure the API is running before sending requests.

Use Postman or curl for API testing.
