Fake Food Delivery API - McDonald's Clone

Description

This project is a REST API for a fake food delivery system using FastAPI. It allows managing a menu for a single restaurant (McDonald's) and includes endpoints for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting menu items. The API also supports image uploads, sorting, filtering, and batch operations.

🔄 Idempotency Analysis

✅ Idempotent Routes

These routes return the same response when called multiple times with the same input:

GET /menu → Fetching menu items does not change the state.

GET /menu/{item_id} → Fetching a specific item is read-only.

DELETE /menu/{item_id} → If the item exists, it is deleted; if repeated, it returns 404 (same result).

DELETE /menu/batch_delete → Deleting items by condition will always return the same response if repeated.

PUT /menu/{item_id} → Updating an item with the same data multiple times has no extra effect.

⚠️ Non-Idempotent Routes

These routes modify the state and return different results on repeated calls:

POST /menu → Creating a new item multiple times adds duplicates.

PUT /menu/batch_update → Increases prices each time it is called.

📌 Notes

Ensure the API is running before sending requests.

Use Postman or curl for API testing.
